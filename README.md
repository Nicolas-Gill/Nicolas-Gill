## Read-Only MEmory
Hello! My name is Nicolas Gill, but I usually go by Nick. I'm currently a junior studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity. My academic interests mainly revolve around lower-level programming and hacking, but my interests will expand as I finish my degree and learn more about cybersecurity.

This account does not get used much during the school year, but I hope to start uploading my personal projects soon!
